-> Content

This mod currently features:
- 100+ swords

- 2 new mechanics

-> Mechanics

This mod introduces new mechanics for the melee class, such as:

-> Projectile Reflection

While attacking, every sword now has a small chance of reflecting hostile projectiles.

A mechanic similar to the Nebula armor's set bonus. On Hardmode, for every time the player hits an enemy, there's a chance of dropping hearts or other boosters (melee damage or speed).
